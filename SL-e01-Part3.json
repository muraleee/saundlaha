We need the grace of Devi to even to worship, even to praise her, even to prostrate her, even to think about her. Amma tells a small story. See, when one wants to go to a house, there is a board outside. Careful of the dogs. Be careful about the dogs. So he understands that there is a dog inside or there are many dogs inside. side. The house owner is growing pet dogs. They may bite you sometimes. So he telephones him and asks him to tie up the dogs and then he enters the house. Then he is not bitten written by them. So similarly, the illusionary power of Devi is great. It can make a great person also he can be he can be disturbed by the power of illusion so it's better to surrender to Devi so that that illusion does not affect him It says that even the greatest of persons are suffering by the illusion of Devi. It is told in Bhagavad Gita that that Daivikesha gunamai mamamaya duratthaya mamayavaya prabadyante maya metam tarantite. This means the illusionary power of Devi is great. One who surrenders to the Lord is not not affected by that illusion. He escapes that process. So, when we enter the house with the permission of the house owner, we are not afflicted by the sufferings of the pet animals or the dogs etc. So similarly, here Pranam Tum Stotam Vakatha Makrita Punya it is told. One who is not worshipping Devi will be afflicted by the illusionary power of Devi also. So we need the grace of Devi to worship her. So it tells about the highest power that exists in the universe. Under her the pancha krityas or the five activities happen. So it is important to worship the highest power in the universe so that we are not afflicted by the powers of Devi, we get liberated. So one who is a mokshetu or one who is interested, one who is interested in Then the liberation, one who is interested in the self-realization, he must worship Devi.
