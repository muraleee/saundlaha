Om Dhyayamo Dhavalava Gunthanavati Tejo Mayim Naishthikem Snigdha Paangavilokini Bhagavati Mandasmita Shreemukhi Vatsalya Mrtavarsinim Sumadhuram Sankirtanala Pini Samagim Madhusikta Suttim Amritanandatmikami Shari My humble prostrations and to the Lotus Feet of Amma. Earlier I have given a brief introduction about Swamdali Lahari. Now I am going to explain verse by verse the brief meaning, the importance of that particular sloka. So there are 100 beautiful verses written by Adi Shankaracharya. Some people attribute it to somebody else. The first 41 slokas are called as Ananda Lahari. The second part of it, 59 slokas are called as Saundari Lahari. Lahari means intoxication. The poet is intoxicated by the beauty of Devi. It is the general meaning of the sloka. It is told that Adi Shankaracharya went to Kailasa. And on the mountains, 100 slokas were written. And while coming, Shankaracharya wrote them and came back. By the time Nandikeshwara did not want that to happen, he wanted that celestial beautiful slokas. Not to be taken to the earth. So he prevented Shankaracharya and grabbed some part of it. Still Shankaracharya got 41 verses. Rest of the 59 slokas he himself wrote and completed the Saundari Lahari. It is a Shataka or 100 slokas. There are in some versions, there are 5 or 6 slokas more. But generally it is considered as a Shataka or 100 slokas. The first 41 of them are describing the philosophy behind the Shakta worship or Devi worship. Later 59 describes the celestial beauty of Devi. So we will try to understand the meaning of Saundari Lahari. Cut here.
