The first verse is like this. It's very popular. This is the verse. The brief meaning of this is like this. When united with Devi, when he is united with Shakti, Shiva is able to perform his duty. It is told that only this is the meaning of this verse. Only then he will be able to act. Otherwise, otherwise, he is not even able to move. That is why you are the Aradhyadevi. You are the Devi to be worshipped. Hari, Hara, Virincha, Adi, Bhirapi. Even the three Murthis, Hari, Hara and Virinchi, who is Brahma, Virincha, Adi, it is told there are 32 crores of Devatas, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Agni, Vayu, etc. Even they are not able to move. They are not able to perform their duties. They are not able to act. Pranantam Stotamva. How can we act? How can one worship you? How can one prostrate you? Stotamva, how can he praise you by hymns? Katham Akrita Punya Prabhavati. One who has not done meritorious acts in hundreds of births, without that, they will not be able to praise you nor able to worship you nor able to prostrate you. So, this is the... very brief meaning. Even the Lord Shiva, who is considered as the highest of the Devatas, will not be able to perform without your power, without your grace. When he is not united with you, he is unable to perform any duties. That is why, you are worshipped by all the Devi Devas, Devi Devatas. So, you are worshipped by all the Devi Devas, Devi Devatas. Like Indra, Varuna, Yama, Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma. Without doing meritorious acts in their previous birth, it is impossible to worship you. It is impossible to worship you by body, by mind and by the organ of speech. They will not be able to praise you. They will not be able to think you, think about you. They will not be able to prostrate you by body. They will not be able to serve you also. So, the first sloka, or the first verse, tells the importance of being pure, being... doing meritorious acts, acquiring Punya in many births. Only then will we be able to worship Devi. A person who is impure in thoughts, deeds and words will not be able to worship Devi. The word Shiva comes from the root Vashi, Akarshan, attracting, etc. There are many meanings. In Sanskrit, one word will be used in multiple senses. It is told in the Shakta Tantras, or in the texts which describe the worship of Devi, that Devi gives birth to Lord Shiva. There are five acts in the Yudhishthira, or the five elements of the universe, Srishti or creation, Stheti, maintenance, Samhara, destruction, Tirodhana, or the illusionary power, Anugraha, or the power to bless one and liberate him from the cycle of births and deaths. So, these are all the Panchakarthya. It is told in all the Shakta Tantras, Devi is the Panchakarthya Parayana. There is a name in the Dalitasaasana, telling that she is Panchakarthya Parayana, who does all the five karmas, five actions of the universe. So, here the word Shiva means the person, one who destroys. Brahma creates. Vishnu sustains. And Isana, Ishwara, is doing the illusionary, he is the illusionary power. Sadashiva is the person who blesses and liberates one from the births and death. So, here, it is told that without the power of Devi, Shiva is unable to perform his action. It is further described in the upcoming slokas. It is told that when Devi signals, the five Devatas perform their actions, like creation, destruction. And sustenance, etc. So, they acquire their power from Devi. So, this is how the first sloka describes. There is an incidence, which I will describe now. Once there was a conference of the Vedic Pandits in Trichy, which was led by Kanchi Paramacharya Shri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati. It was a Vedic, the subject was about Vedas. So, the first day, as usual, there should be a prayer, the convocation should, I mean, the prayer should be there to begin the program. There is a lighting ceremony and the first person to do the prayer is Kanchi Paramacharya, or Chandrashekharendra Saraswati himself was present. And there were many scholars, Ganapathis, who were experts in Vedas. There was one great scholar in Trichy, who was 80 years old. Paramacharya noticed that he has not come for the program. He enquired about that, why he has not come. He is a very good scholar and he should be present when we start the program. It was the time to start the program, but Kanchi Paramacharya wanted the other scholar to come and he delayed the program because he was such an important person. So, that Ganapathi also was... Somebody went in search of him and he went to his house. They found that this person was having asthma and was very old and he could not come. They told that Paramacharya wanted him to participate in the program. He said, I am sick, I am unable to chant the Vedas because I am having severe wheezing. Because the pontiff or the priest or the Paramacharya wanted him to come, he agreed to come to the venue. He came to the venue and expressed his disability to chant Vedas because he was very old, was also sick, was also having wheezing. So, Paramacharya said, even if you are not able to chant the Vedas, it doesn't matter. You tell some sloka from Sunder Lahari, you will be able to do it. So, he agreed to that and chanted this particular verse, Siva Shaktya Yipto Yadibhavati Shakta Prabhavidam Na Chedevam Devo Nakalukosalaspandidam Api Atasthvaam Aaradhyaam Harihara Virinchaadibhir Api Pranam Tumstotam Vagatham Akrita Punya Prabhavati And the program went on well and this person went back to his home. After some time, Kanchi Paramacharya asked, See, it is regularly, it is the custom to start a Vedic conference with Vedic chanting. Now, he has done a chanting of a particular sloka from Sunder Lahari. So, he asked the scholars what they think about it. Whether they think that it is right or wrong. What is their opinion about starting the program with Sunder Lahari? Because it was not the custom. So, everybody kept quiet because they didn't know exactly the answer. In the end, Shankaracharya himself explained that there is a particular portion in the Rudra, Yate Siva Tanuhu Siva Visvaah Bhesha Ji Like that it goes, Tayanoham Hrida Jeevasahe It ends like this. It means, without Shakti, the Shiva cannot exist. Tayanoham Hrida Jeevasahe He is not able to live. It is a symbolic representation. So, without Shakti, the Shiva is unable to perform. He is unable to exist. So, this is the meaning. So, the very same meaning is expressed by Shankaracharya in a poetical way. So, that is why it is nothing wrong. There is no difference in the thoughts of Shankaracharya and Vedas. Because the Vedartha is being expressed in a different way. Or the meaning of the Vedas are expressed in a different way by Shankaracharya. So, everybody were happy and everybody accepted that. Because the Pandit could not chant the Vedas, he was having breathlessness. So, Shankaracharya accepted the Sandal Lahari Sloga to be the prayer song of the whole conference. So, this tells the importance of Sandal Lahari. It is not different from Vedas. It is not different from the Vedarthas. The same ideas are conveyed in a poetical way by Adi Shankara. So, Devi is responsible for Srishti, creation, Stithi, sustenance, Sambhara, dissolution, Thirodhana, illusion, and Anugraha. And the power to liberate. So, she is the most powerful goddess who can liberate one from the cycle of birth and death. I remember another incidence where the same thing happened. Amma had a public program in Kottayam long back, very long back. At that time, persons from different status of the society were present. There was a bishop, there were sannyas and sannyas in mayors, political people, etc. And this stage was decorated by a great yogi who is called as Malliur. Shankara Nambodari. He was also very old. He was also having a same problem, a missing problem. Thousands of people were gathered. And Malliur Nambodari was invited for the program. He was very old. He was not able to walk. He was very young. He was very old. Still, because Amma was coming for the program, Amma was conducting her program, she agreed to come. He is a great scholar in Bhagavata. He used to read Bhagavata and explain Bhagavata. Respected by thousands of people. At that point, he was unable to speak. He was having missing problems. So, he was brought to this stage. And he was asked to speak a few words. And he started his speech with Saundarya Lahari. He chanted this sloka, Avidyanaam Antasthmi Ramihira Deepanagari Jataanaam Chaitanyaastha Bhagamakaranthasrati Shalini Jataanaam Chaitanyaastha Bhagamakaranthasrati Shalini. Daridraanaam Chintamani Gunanika Janma Jalatho Dhimaganaanam Damsha Muradipuvarahasya Bhavati Damsha Muradipuvarahasya Bhavati So, and briefly explained the greatness of Devi in few words. in few words. And departed from the stage because he was sick. That also gave a lot of color to the program. A great devotional spirit was conveyed because it was conveyed from a person who was a great sadhaka, who was a great sadhaka, great seeker. So, in this particular sloka also So, in this particular sloka also the five krityas or the five activities are done by Devi. are done by Devi. It is impossible for a person It is impossible for a person who is not qualified enough who has not done the work and meritorious acts in hundreds of births to worship, to praise or think about Devi. Yadiva Paschimam Janma Yadiva Shankaraswayam Yadiva Paschimam Janma Yadiva Shankaraswayam If he has not done If he has not done if it is not his last birth or one who is not a lord Shiva himself will he be able to do will he be able to do to worship Devi?
