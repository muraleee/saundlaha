The first verse is like this. It's very popular. This is the verse. The brief meaning of this is like this. When united with Devi, when he is united with Shakti, Shiva is able to perform his duty. It is told that only this is the meaning of this verse. Only then he will be able to act. Otherwise, otherwise, he is not even able to move. That is why you are the Aradhyadevi. You are the Devi to be worshipped. Hari, Hara, Virincha, Adi, Bhirapi. Even the three Murthis, Hari, Hara and Virinchi, who is Brahma, Virincha, Adi, it is told there are 32 crores of Devatas, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Agni, Vayu, etc. Even they are not able to move. They are not able to perform their duties. They are not able to act. Pranantam Stotamva. How can we act? How can one worship you? How can one prostrate you? Stotamva, how can he praise you by hymns? Katham Akrita Punya Prabhavati. One who has not done meritorious acts in hundreds of births, without that, they will not be able to praise you nor able to worship you nor able to prostrate you. So, this is the... very brief meaning. Even the Lord Shiva, who is considered as the highest of the Devatas, will not be able to perform without your power, without your grace. When he is not united with you, he is unable to perform any duties. That is why, you are worshipped by all the Devi Devas, Devi Devatas. So, you are worshipped by all the Devi Devas, Devi Devatas. Like Indra, Varuna, Yama, Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma. Without doing meritorious acts in their previous birth, it is impossible to worship you. It is impossible to worship you by body, by mind and by the organ of speech. They will not be able to praise you. They will not be able to think you, think about you. They will not be able to prostrate you by body. They will not be able to serve you also. So, the first sloka, or the first verse, tells the importance of being pure, being... doing meritorious acts, acquiring Punya in many births. Only then will we be able to worship Devi. A person who is impure in thoughts, deeds and words will not be able to worship Devi. The word Shiva comes from the root Vashi, Akarshan, attracting, etc. There are many meanings. In Sanskrit, one word will be used in multiple senses. It is told in the Shakta Tantras, or in the texts which describe the worship of Devi, that Devi gives birth to Lord Shiva. There are five acts in the Yudhishthira, and in the Vedic scriptures, there are five types of the five elements. The first is the the third is the the third is the the fourth is the the fifth is the the sixth is the the seventh is the the eighth is the seventh is the the eighth is the the five five sustains. And Ishana, Ishwara is doing the illusionary power. Sadashiva is the person who blesses and liberates one from birth and death. So here it is told that without the power of Devi, Shiva is unable to perform his action. It is further described in the upcoming slokas. It is told that when Devi signals to Shiva, the five Devatas perform their actions like creation, destruction and sustenance etc. So they acquire their power from Devi. So this is how the first sloka describes. There is an incidence which I will describe now. Once there was a conference. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The subject was about Vedas. So the first day, as usual there should be a prayer, the convocation should, I mean the prayer should be there. to begin the program. There was a lighting ceremony and Panchi Paramacharya or Chandrashekhar and Saraswati himself was present. And there were many scholars, Jnana parties, who were experts in Vedas. There was one great scholar in Trichy who was 80 years old. Paramacharya noticed that he has not come for the program. He inquired about that. Why he has not come? He is a very good scholar and he should be present when we start the program. It was the time to start the program but Panchi Paramacharya wanted the other scholar to come and he delayed the program because he was such an important person. So that Jnana party also was... Somebody went in search of him and he went to his house. They found that this person was having asthma and was very old and he could not come. They told that Paramacharya wanted him to participate in the program. He said, I am sick. I am unable to chant the Vedas because I am having severe wheezing. Because the pontiff or Paramacharya wanted him to come he agreed to come to the venue. He came to the venue and expressed his disability to chant Vedas because he was very old. He was also sick. He was also having wheezing. So Paramacharya said if you are unable to chant the Vedas then�esty It doesn't matter. You tell some sloka from Sandal Lahari. So he agreed to that and chanted this particular verse. And the program went on well and this person went back to his home. After some time, Kanchi Paramacharya asked, see it is regularly, it is the custom to start a Vedic conference with Vedic chanting. Now he has done it. He chanted a chanting of a particular sloka from Sandal Lahari. So he asked the scholars what they think about it. Whether they think that it is right or wrong. What is their opinion about starting the program with Sandal Lahari? Because it was not the custom. Everybody kept quiet because they didn't know exactly the answer. In the end, Shankaracharya himself explained that there is a particular portion in the Rudra. Yate Shiva Tanuhu Shiva Vishwa Bhishaji. Like that it goes. It ends like this. It means without Shakti, Shiva cannot exist. He is not able to live. It is a symbolic representation. So without Shakti, Shiva is unable to perform. He is unable to exist. So this is the meaning. So the very same meaning is expressed by Shankaracharya in a poetical way. So that is why it is nothing wrong. There is no difference in the thoughts of Shankaracharya and Vedas. Because the Vedartha is being expressed in a different way. Or the meaning of the Vedas are expressed in a different way by Shankaracharya. So everybody were happy and everybody accepted that. Because the Pandavas... The Pandavas could not chant the Vedas. He was having breathlessness. So Shankaracharya accepted the Sandal Lahari Sloga to be the prayer song of the whole conference. So this tells the importance of Sandal Lahari. It is not different from Vedas. It is not different from the Vedarthas. The same ideas are conveyed. In a poetical way by Adi Shankara. So Devi is responsible for Srishti creation, Sthiti sustenance, Sambhara dissolution, Thirodhana illusion, and Anugraha. And the power to liberate. So she is the most powerful goddess. Who can liberate one from the cycle of birth and death. I remember another incidence where the same thing happened. Amma had a public program in Kottayam long back. Very long back. At the time, persons from different... different status of the society were present. There was a bishop, there was a... there were sannyas, sannyasins, mayors, political people, etc. And this stage was decorated by a great yogi who is called as Malliur Shankaran Nambodari. He was also very old. He was also having a same problem. Weasing problem. And there was just a little problem since 1994. finishes. 1,000 small businesses are so old. 500 ch salt sites are There was strange every decision. During the 1967ison movement of 파 raporamkasi of Amma, in K где Ter Saudyon amager bitcoin came and fewening time also. falling off. See, he agreed to come. He is a great scholar in Bhagavata. He used to read Bhagavata and explain Bhagavata. He was respected by thousands of people. At that point he was unable to speak. He was having missing problems. So he was brought to the stage and he was asked to speak a few words. He started his speech with the sound of the Lahari. He chanted the sloka, Avidyamantastamiramihiradeepanagari, Jatam chaitanyastha bhagamakaranam dasruthi shari. . Daridranamchintamani gunanika janma jaladho dimagnanam. Damsha murudipubara ahasya bhavati. He briefly explained the greatness of Devi in few words. He departed from the stage because he was sick. That also gave a lot of color to the program. A great devotional spirit was conveyed. It was conveyed from a person who was a great sadhaka, a great seeker. In this particular sloka also, the five krityas or the five activities are done by Devi. It is impossible for a person who is not qualified enough, who has not done meritorious acts in hundreds of births, to worship, to praise or think about Devi. Yadiva paschimam janma yadiva sankaraswayam. If he has not done, if it is not his last birth, or one who is not Lord Shiva himself, will he be able to do it? Will he be able to worship Devi? There are three types of worships. Kahika or the worship by body, like prostrating by cleaning the temple etc. By doing pujas to the Devi. Which is done by the physical body. Or Vachika, writing poetry, singing the glories of Devi. It is called as Vachika worship. Or the worship by the organ of speech. Or by mind, by thinking, by contemplating on Devi. It is impossible to worship her. Without doing meritorious acts in hundreds of births. Very good. Anathema.. Anathema.. Yes. This question.. Fighting for an area.
